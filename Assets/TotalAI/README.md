Total AI (TAI) is a complete free open source agent based AI Framework for Unity. TAI is currently in Alpha.

The core of TAI are Agents who can to sense the world, create memories, plans, and act in order to either reduce their Drives or based on the action with the most utility. This is accomplished with its Type System and Plan/Mapping System. It is also easy to extend and customize through ScriptableObject's pluggable data and logic ability. This makes writing and plugging in your own custom AI logic easy.
